# Tactics
## (Placeholder name)

This repository is home to a (currently prototypical) tactical RPG for mobile devices.  The concept is a game in which users recruit and empower heroes and soldiers used to fight on a grid based combat terrain.

## Design concepts under consideration:
- Setting
  - Most likely fantasy
  - Possibly futuristic
- Grid cardinality
  - Current incumbent is hex-grid
  - Possibly change to classical 4-grid
- F2P P2P balancing mechanism
  - To be done largely through limiting number of hero slots in a given battle
  - Cash item availability will also play into this
  - Auction house or other trade options may also alleviate this
- Game modes
  - Campaign
    - Story-driven single player
    - Co-op campaign may also encourage user-base expansion
  - Idle
    - Deployment type mechanism encourages users to return periodically
    - Possible yields include:
      - Unit recruits
      - Items
      - Player/unit experience
      - Premium currency
  - PvP
    - Arena
      - Idle mode forces focus on team composition, is not limited by active user-base
      - Active combat requiring engagement from 1 or both parties for separate ladder
    - Colosseum
      - Active PvP with entrance fee and bracket system with prizes
    - KoTH
      - One player with hero against multiple with generic units
    - CTF
      - Game modes with non-combat victory conditions encourage exploration in team composition
    - Stagnation prevention
      - In order to prevent one mode from stealing all focus, use the following:
        - Daily quests with additional rewards for mode participation
        - Tickets to allow free instance hosting (with host bonus)
  - Co-op
    - Hosted battles with players against AI
      - Each player fills a single party slot
  - Endurance
    - Player fights multiple battles with same party to earn unique rewards
  - LAN
    - Above multiplayer game modes can be made available on LAN (with bonus) to promote user-base expansion
- Procedural character generation
  - Generic (non-hero) characters should be generated automatically
- Character proliferation
  - Character combination
    - Merge (prefer not breed) characters to generate offspring with mixed traits
    - Possible premium items may include option for control over resulting traits
  - Lineage system
    - The longer a lineage persists, the stronger it becomes
    - May consider a mechanism to retire (collapse) a lineage for a boost
  - Interaction between unique/generic characters
    - Heroes should have unique passive abilities granted to other members of party
- Power creep control
  - Hero roster
    - In order to limit the meta-game from targeting a small subset of characters, rotate available heroes
  - Party limits
    - Heroes will only comprise part of the party, with generic characters filling in the rest
- Character variety
  - Class system
    - Each character will have one or more of the following classes, influencing their role in the party:
      - Archer (Ranged damage)
      - Bard (Buff support)
      - Beastmaster (Melee attack and beast taming in non-PvP)
      - Builder (Map manipulation/fortification)
      - Cleric (Buff/Heal support)
      - Craftsman (Possibly, focus would be largely non-combat)
      - Summoner (Squishy, generates adds)
      - Warrior (Melee damage)
      - Etc.
    - Classes can be categorized as follows:
      - Offense
      - Defense
      - Support
      - Miscellaneous
    - Class inheritance
      - As a lineage extends, successors are granted a primary skill set biased toward their ancestors'
      - Successors are granted most (all?) secondary class abilities which must be unlocked to construct a unique secondary skill-set
  - Titles
    - Unit and player titles are granted when certain feats are achieved
      - A finite number of titles can be applied at any one time, and each grants a unique bonus
      - Unit titles are inherited by successors in a given unit's lineage
  - Type system
    - Elemental types
      - Elemental precedence chain, where each element has a strength and a weakness
        - Pro: Recognizable, Intuitive
        - Con: Overused
    - Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing
      - Similar to elemental types above, can be layered on top for additional complexity
    - Beast/Human/Hybrid
      - Beasts provide added mobility as mounts and act as melee units
        - May also have exaggerated elemental and map tile affinities
      - Humans follow traditional class system as described above
      - Hybrids follow traditional class system as humans do, but with exaggerated affinities as with beasts
- Map characteristics
  - Tile types
    - Influence movement
    - May also interplay with elemental type system
